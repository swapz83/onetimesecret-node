      <h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
      <h4>What if I forgot to copy the shared link?</h4>
      <p>You need to create a new secret. We can't retrieve it for you.</p>

      <h4>How long will the secret be available?</h4>
      <p>The secret link will be available for 7 days or until it's viewed.</p>

      <h4>What happens when I burn a secret?</h4>
      <p>Burning a secret will delete it before it has been read. If you send someone a secret link and burn the secret before they view it, they will not be able to read it. In fact, it will look to them like the secret never existed at all.</p>
